mingw32-runtime (3.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch IN, OUT and OPTIONAL 'documentation' macros to prefix
    them with __W32_ and get them out of the global namespace.
  * The previous patch has been accepted upstream, and this one
    has preliminary approval -- please report any teething
    problems to me, at this stage I can find none I've missed,
    or any I've changed wrongly, but its a big hunt for common
    symbols, so there could be a few.  Thanks for your patience
    and testing!

  * runtime-3.3 / w32api-2.5.
  * mingw 3.3.3 and 3.4.1 both seem flakey, but the new runtime has many
    fixes worth incorporating before the freeze, so this is a runtime
    update for the existing 3.3.1 compiler release.

mingw32-runtime (2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * runtime-2.2 / w32api-2.0 release.  Closes: #141485 too.
  * Built with gcc3.2, expecially since builds of 2.95 appear 
    to have gone (and remained) down the toilet.  It appears
    to work fine with 2.95, but none of the recent 2.95
    releases actually build anymore.
